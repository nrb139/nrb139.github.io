            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
                I'm Nolan Bennett, a photographer at heart and Penn State student
                studying Digital Multimedia Design (B.Des.) My journey with
                photography began as a way to document my travels and experiences, but
                it quickly evolved into a passionate hobby of capturing the world's
                beauty through my lens.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've captured photos in some incredible locations, from the dramatic
                landscapes of Spain, to islands in the Caribbean, to the varied
                landscapes of Ecuador. Everywhere I've travelled has helped me develop
                a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and natural environments.
                These experiences have shaped my art and taught me to find
                extraordinary moments in everyday scenes.
            </p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>
                This site focuses on 3 areas of my photography: landscapes that
                showcase nature's grandeur, architecture that highlights human
                creativity, and wildlife that captures authentic moments in nature.
                Each genre requires different techniques and patience, but they all
                share a common goal— creating images that resonate with viewers and
                tell compelling visual stories.
            </p>

            <h2>Beyond Photography</h2>
            <p>
                When I'm not behind the camera, you'll find me hiking, camping, or
                working on other creative pursuits like calligraphy and crochet. I'm
                also passionate about mindfulness practices and enjoy exploring how
                photography can be a meditative practice - learning to be fully
                present in the moment while creating.
            </p>

            <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
            <p>
                I'm always interested in connecting with fellow photographers,
                potential clients, and anyone who appreciates visual storytelling. If
                you're interested in commissioning work, purchasing prints, or simply
                want to discuss photography techniques, feel free to reach out through
                my <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.
